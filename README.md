# Supercomputing Galactic Evolution: a two-dimensional simulation of a gravitational N-Body problem

To study the evolution of a galaxy, one has to simulate the movement, under the force of
gravity, of a great many stars in that galaxy. 
This project has the following main aims:	
	A (single-processor) program which simulates, in two dimensions, the evolution of a galaxy or a solar system using Newton’s 	law of gravity
	A parallel program to run the ‘evolution’ simulation
	A program to visualise the movement of the bodies in the galaxy or solarsystem
